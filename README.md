Project 4
# Overview
* In this project we use the healthcare database to determine how each of the factors relate to each other, such as age, pre-existing conditions, charge, costs, county, number of people per age group, count, and gender. We then use machine learning to train an algorithm to predict the total charge.
# Process
* After cleaning the dataset, we populate the database using pyspark.sql. This falicitates the identification of patient and hospital factors.
* We then create visualisations of how each factor affects the total charge.
# Machine Learning
* We then see what model best predicts our total charge results.
